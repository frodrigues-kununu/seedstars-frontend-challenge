##Challenge Details

###Frontend Engineer Challenge
===========================

The purpose of this challenge is to understand how you use HTML/CSS/Javascript. 
Please note that both challenges are mandatory. 


Challenge 1 - Javascript
------------------------

Build a HackerNews (http://news.ycombinator.com/) infinite scroll news listing page.

Using one of the many online API to connect to HackerNews, get the data, and build a webpage
which lists all the items from HN. The page should have infinite scroll (when user reaches the
end of the page more articles should be loaded).

No need to do any special design here, please focus on functionality and performance.


Challenge 2 - Html/CSS
----------------------

Please design a webpage using html/css, preferably using tools that simplify your life eg: SCSS, gulp.js, etc
Have a look at HTML_CSS.zip for the design reference of what you should implement.

The the resulting webpage should be responsive.


Make reasonable assumptions, state your assumptions, and proceed. Once you have completed the
challenge let us know and share your thoughts on the problems/solutions.

Good luck!
